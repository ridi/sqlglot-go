"""
proxy-monster Layer-1 lineage probe on sqlglot — emits the ProbeResult contract the Kotlin
enforcement triad consumes (origins / references / isWrite).

Contract (see engine/.../probe/ProbeResult.kt):
  resolved       : reached lineage (else fail-closed DENY)
  failedStage    : PARSE | VALIDATE | CONVERT | LINEAGE  (on failure)
  origins        : ordered [{column, origins:[base 'table.col']}] — ordinal = output position (masking binds by it)
  references     : {RefContext: [base cols]} — source cols used OUTSIDE the SELECT output; any
                   masked/denied column here → DENY. A conservation backstop routes every column a
                   statement touches in an unmodeled position (incl. a write's payload) to OTHER, so
                   the analyzer is fail-closed by default rather than ALLOW-by-default.
  isWrite        : INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE/SELECT-INTO or CTAS/CREATE VIEW — a write can't be
                   masked, so any masked/denied column it touches (origins ∪ references) is DENY.

The RefContext bucket only feeds the audit reason string; the DENY decision needs only the *union*
of non-output references.

# B. sqlglot PARSE GAPS — sqlglot's grammar can't STRUCTURE the statement, so there's no AST to reason
#    about (no columns / tables / lineage) → fail-closed at PARSE. Not fixable in our logic:
#      • MySQL `REPLACE INTO …`         — sqlglot yields an opaque Command node, not an Insert.
#      • MySQL `INSERT … SET col = val` — sqlglot raises ParseError (SET-form INSERT unsupported).
#    Fix path if needed: normalize to an analyzable form before parse (REPLACE→INSERT, INSERT…SET→
#    INSERT(cols) VALUES), or upgrade sqlglot if a later grammar models them.
#
# C. INTENTIONAL fail-closed — parses fine, but exposes no analyzable lineage and/or is a policy call:
#      • plain `CREATE TABLE t (cols)` (no AS-query) — creates an empty table, reads nothing; a
#        DDL-authorization decision, not a lineage one.
#      • `COPY (SELECT …) TO …` / bulk-export commands — a raw exfiltration path; deny by default.
#      • data-modifying CTE `WITH a AS (INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|MERGE …) …` — a write nested in a WITH;
#        multi-target CTE-DML lineage is a re-architecture, so fail closed (see the guard below).
#      • a table-valued function as a STANDALONE FROM source that sqlglot models as a table, e.g.
#        `FROM generate_series(1,10) g` — fails the catalog must-exist check ("unknown table"). (A TVF
#        in a LATERAL, e.g. `… CROSS JOIN LATERAL generate_series(…) g`, IS analyzed: its argument
#        columns route through the table-function source pass.)
